## About me 

As a curious and proactive junior software engineer, I am driven by a passion for continuous improvement. With a background in pensions and starting at a fast paced start-up, I continued to grow rapidly with the company over the next 5 years. I have honed my communication skills through daily interactions with high net worth clients, various professionals and colleagues I managed.

I highly value agile methodologies for their ability to deliver high-quality software efficiently. Proficient in OOP, TDD, paired programming, and agile practices, I am eager to apply my skills and curiosity to a role where I can write impactful code for meaningful programs.

With a strong work ethic, excellent problem-solving abilities, and a natural inclination for learning, I am confident in my ability to contribute value to any team. I am excited about the prospect of joining a dynamic and forward-thinking team, where I can make a positive impact and continue to grow as a developer.

## Skills

#### Communication
Strong collaboration, teamwork and interpersonal skills at all levels with both clients and colleagues which has been demonstrated whilst leading monthly meetings for my colleagues and devising successful client meetings. 

At Makers, I have had to utilise this skill to be able to effectively explain ideas and technical approaches whilst pair programming almost daily and during group projects. 

#### Adaptability 

I am not afraid to take on new challenges, whether it be working in a different agile style or learnning new langages; during Makers I demonstrated a knack for swiftly adapting to new programming languages.

At the start-up, the dynamic of the company was ever changing so I had to be able to change direction when needed, handle ambiguity and comminicate feedback regularly. 


#### Analytical thinker 

Able to brainstorm ideas and focus on addressing issues before they arise. When conducting new client meetings in my last role, I would assess the situation and client needs to design a personalised solution for them, often on the spot, to maximise their pension pot whilst using the most tax efficient processes for their limited company. 

During Makers, I would have to analyse information presented to me in order to debug code or build according to the brief in the most accurate and efficient manner.
